# porcelain

A UI toolkit using [miniquad](https://github.com/not-fl3/miniquad) for rendering.

## Goals

- render a 2D graphical interface
- immediate mode layout system
- (somewhat) easy to use
- (debatable) composed of crates so can discard what is not used
- have fun making this
- more added later?

## Why "porcelain"?

This saga started when I watched Nic Barker's [Clay](https://github.com/nicbarker/clay).
Fired clay synonyms are ceramic, porcelain, etc, so I went with porcelain.
